        <br>
        <p>Gagosian has been a key player in many aspects of the art industry. They are without a doubt the leading
          gallery when it comes to the digital marketplace, they were the first gallery to establish a publishing house
          rivaling the traditional art publishers with over 500 publications up to now, there is their Gagosian
          Quarterly magazine, online articles and other cultural programs marked by transparency, historical
          scholarships, research, market insights and more.
          The numbers of Gagosian are simply mind-blowing as they outgrow the definition of the art gallery. Even more
          impressive is the number of established artists and estates they work with, think of Georg Baselitz, Gerhard
          Richter, John Currin, Anselm Kiefer, Damien Hirst, Andreas Gursky, Jenny Saville, Y.Z. Kami, Jeff Koons,
          Richard Prince, Jeff Wall, Rudolf Stingel and many more.

        <h3>Pace Gallery - Geneva, Switzerland</h3>

        <p>Pace Gallery was founded in 1960 by Arne Glimcher in Boston and is currently directed by his son Marc
          Glimcher.
          Today, the gallery has nine locations across the globe including spaces in London, Geneva Palo Alto, Hong
          Kong, Seoul, East Hampton (temporary), Palm Beach (seasonal), two galleries in New York and is set to expand
          again during fall of this year with a larger space in London. As a result, Pace covers over 15.000 square
          meters of exhibition space and has around 150 employees in their international staff.

        <h3>Hauser & Wirth - New York, USA</h3>
        <a href="https://www.selldorf.com/projects/hauser-wirth-18th-street">

        <p>Hauser & Wirth has two galleries in New York and Somerset and a gallery in London, Los Angeles, Hong Kong,
          St. Moritz, Zurich, Gstaad, Rämistrasse, Southampton, Menorca, Monaco and Chilida Leku covering 20.000 square
          meters with approximately 200 employees.[17] A unique and admirable aspect of Hauser & Wirth's vision when it
          comes to these gallery locations, is their affinity towards architecture and cultural heritage. Instead of
          building new state of the art gallery spaces, they restore historical buildings, revisiting their environments
          and contribute to a constructive approach towards culture sites and heritage issues, connecting contemporary
          art with history.
          Further, Hauser & Wirth is an active contributor when it comes to academic research – strongly connected to
          their specialized publishing activities – organizing landmark exhibitions in collaboration with renowned
          curators, presenting high end surveys and investing in scholarship, research and education. Doing so, the
          gallery achieves museum quality exhibitions and adds immens value to their gallery program, the art world and
          culture in general.
